Axelrod dissemination of culture
---------------------------------

Each agent has a state with two vector variables. A cultural trait array with size 5 and each position with values between 1 and 10, and a similarity integer with range 0 to 4.
Agents state's change with interactions. Given an agent and its linked neighbors, the agent picks one neighbor to mix its culture with. If their similarity, defined as the average of equal cultural features is bigger than a random value, then the process of cultura mixing starts. The process of cultural mix is done by choosing one of the different features in the culture array and agreeing to the same value.

 Originally, links between agents are defined by proximity in the 2d plane.

 The methodology of the present study is based on three principles:

1. Agent-based modeling. Mechanisms of change are specified for local actors, and then consequences of these mechanisms are examined to discover the emergent properties of the system when many actors interact.3 simulation is especially helpful for Computer this bottom-up but its use predates the availability of personal computers approach, (e.g., Schelling 1978).
2. No central authority. Consistent with the agent-based approach is the lack of any central coordinating agent in the model. It is certainly true that important aspects of cultures sometimes come to be standardized, canonized, and disseminated by powerful authorities such as church fathers, Webster, and Napoleon. The present model, however, deals with the process of social influence before (or alongside of) the actions of such authorities.  It seeks to understand and stability can just how much of cultural emergence to the coordinating be explained without resorting influence of centralized authority.
3. Adaptive rather than rational agents. The individuals are assumed to follow simple rules about giving and receiving influence. These rules are not necessarily derivable from any of rational calculation based on costs and benefits or forward-looking principles strategic analysis typical of game theory. Instead, the agents simply adapt to their environmen
